code to generate a hashed password 72 characters long

Here's the simplified summary of what's going on in this lecture:

1. User forgot / wants to change his password

2. We create a new, temporary password for the user using node's crypto module:

const resetToken = crypto.randomBytes(36).toString('hex');
3. This creates a 72 characters long, cryptographically strong (very random) password using hexadecimal encoding (numbers 0-9, letters A-F). Try running this in the terminal to understand the returned value:

node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(4).toString('hex'));"

4. We create the hashed version of this password using the crypto module's createHash function, since we never want to store the plain text password in the database.

5. We chose "sha256" hashing function, which is a very fast operation (as opposed to bcrypt's slow hashing function), which is why we don't need to do this operation asynchronously, as it takes less than a millisecond to complete. The downside to this is that possible attackers can compare our hash to a list of commonly used passwords a lot more times in a given time frame then if using bcrypt, which is a slow operation. So you can do millions of password checks in the same amount of time that it takes to make 1 check using bcrypt. However, this is not a problem here as: a) we used a very long and very random password (as opposed to user generated passwords, which usually have meaning and are far from random) and b) our password is only valid for 10 minutes, so there is literally zero chance for the attacker to guess the password in that short amount of time.

6. We send a plain-text version of our password back to the user so he/she can use it to log-in for the next 10 minutes.

And that's it for this lesson...
