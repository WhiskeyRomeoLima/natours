All we have to do is to actually call promisify. 
So promisify(), and then pass the jwt.verify in there. So promisify(jwt.verify),
And so now, promisify(jwt.verify) is a function that we need to call,
which will then return a promise.

So then this (token, process.env.JWT_SECRET) actually  is the call of the function.
And this also will then return a promise,
and so we can await it and store the result into a variable.
const decoded = await promisify(jwt.verify)(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET)

So that result value of the promise
will actually be the decoded data,
which is the decoded payload from this JSON web token.

const user = await User.findOne({ email }).select('+password');
in the above line of code, we have selected the password field in the 
document so correctPassword function will have access to this.password 
as 'this' refers to the document.

userSchema.methods.verifyPassword = async function(userPassword) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(userPassword, this.password);
 //*versus as done above
                                                     password (unencryped), user.password (encrypted)
userSchema.methods.correctPassword = async function(candidatePassword, userPassword){
    return await bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, userPassword)
}
}

/*
The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. 
The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, 
promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding 
the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

You use an async function when working with Promises in the body of the function.

There are two sets of brackets because this part:

promisify(jwt.verify)
Returns the promisified version of jwt.verify as a function and this part:

(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET)
Executes that function.

//* but this also works
const decoded = await jwt.verify(
    token,
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    {}, // passing an empty options object to get to callback
    (err, value) => {
      if (err) {
        return next(new AppError('Error', 401));
      }
      return value;
    }
  );

    Hi Jordan,
    You can certainly use a callback if you prefer. 
    I don't see any compelling reason to choose it over a Promise though.

 //* This is the source of the confusion
@1:20 Jonas says
So you see that this verify here
is actually an asynchronous function.
So it will verify a token, and then after that,
when it's done, it will then call the callback function that we can specify.

Is there anyone who can explain why we can't use
const decoded = await promisify(jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET));
 
INSTEAD OF
 
const decoded = await promisify(jwt.verify)(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
 
I was expecting to pass the token and  the secrete to jwt.verify and then pass the jwt.verify outcome into promisify so turn into a promise.

Now it looks like the promisify takes jwt.verify func without arguments and the  token and secret are just sitting out of any function.

Hi everyone, just wanted to see if my understanding is correct. Would this explanation be right?

The promisify function is used to wrap the jwt.verfiy() function so that 
we can use await on the returned value of the callback function it produces as a 
result of the jwt.verfiy() running.

A Promise is a function that takes another function as an argument/parameter,
 promises can be handled with resolve and reject to process the results of the 
 returned promise (the result of the callback function when it returns the value of its output), 
 
 In javascript version, ES6 an internal method for handling promises was created, to simplify 
 promises, async...await. It functions the same.

Since we've been using async... await throughout the project, 
the promisify function wrapper is used to better match up the processing of the callback function 
to how we have been using it, by turning the callback into a promise, 
which is functionally the same as using async...await.

without a CB as the 3rd parameter jwt.verify will act synchronously
with a CB as the 3rd parameter jwt.verify will act asynchronously
as per my understanding since we are using promisify on jwt.verify(), behind the scenes the asynchronous version is used implicitly ie jwt.verify(token, 'secret', (error, verifiedJWT ) =>{......} ), because promisify only works on functions whose last parameter is a CB following the error first pattern (error, value)=> {...}
so promisify returns a function which then returns a promise (when subsequently called with token and the secret argument) with a resolved value either an error or the value (verifiedJWT)
and we can therefore await it inside a asynchronous function
so if we use const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET) in our code , it will also work but then we are running it synchronously, which will block the event loop for a time, however small
so in jonas code we are using the asynchronous version implicitly by promisifying it
